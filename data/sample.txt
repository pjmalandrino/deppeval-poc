# Vector Databases in RAG Applications

Vector databases are becoming an essential component in modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. These specialized databases store and efficiently query vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of text, images, or other data.

## Key Features of pgvector

PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension offers several advantages for RAG applications:

1. **Similarity Search**: Quickly find the most similar vectors using various distance metrics (Euclidean, Cosine, Inner Product).
2. **SQL Integration**: Combine vector search with traditional SQL queries for complex filtering.
3. **ACID Compliance**: Benefit from PostgreSQL's transaction guarantees.
4. **Indexing Options**: Use IVFFlat or HNSW indexes for faster approximate nearest neighbor search.
5. **Open Source**: Free to use and modify, with a strong community.

## Integration with Language Models

When using local models like those provided by Ollama, pgvector serves as the memory component in a RAG pipeline:

1. Documents are processed and chunked into manageable pieces.
2. Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding.
3. Embeddings are stored in the vector database.
4. When a query arrives, it's converted to the same vector space.
5. The database performs similarity search to find relevant document chunks.
6. Retrieved chunks are sent to the language model as context.
7. The model generates a response based on both the query and the retrieved context.

This approach enhances model responses with specific knowledge without requiring retraining or fine-tuning of the base model.
